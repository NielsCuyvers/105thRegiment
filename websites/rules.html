                    Breaking any rules will lead to punishment or even a warning of which 3 lead to permanent banning from the 105th and all its communication routes aswell as all servers and any other platforms. Members can also get multiple warnings at once or even banned instantly if their actions are too severe. If you want to take a break or are going on vacation and even if you just aren't interested anymore you can request a regimental time out which will last for as long as you request it to be and will exclude you from any events until your break ends. To request this regimental break you must contact John Cuttler and tell him timeframe aswell as an optional reason for your time out.
