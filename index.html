                    The 105th Regiment of Foot was founded on January 16th of 2018 and is still an active group. After almost 9 months of playing the game Holdfast: Nations at War and 8 months of playing Arma 3 we have gathered a wide array of members from all different walks of life. We offer up to three events each weekend and a hirarchy for you to climb aswell as the possibility of earning a leading rank in our organisation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our leadership, the "council", is built on an oligarchichal system (Oligarchy is a form of power structure in which power rests with a small number of people), which in our case is the most experienced members of our organization.Though some decisions are made by all of our members if the council thinks it is better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you join our organization you will be a full member for a 30-day period. At the end of this period the council decides if you are fit to be a member of the regiment. During your test phase your initiative, maturity and other factors will be observed by all council members.

                <h2>Regimental Section</h2>
                <p>
                    The regimental section is for those who want a well structured and organized group where they can climb the hirarchy of the 105th. The regimental section is for all those who want to experience our well prepared events for both Arma 3 and Mordhau. It is for the people that seek a challenge and that want more than just a group of friends. Here you will find our most dedicated and most loyal members aswell as old 105th veterans and experienced leaders.
                </p>
                <h2>Community Section</h2>
                <p>
                    The community section is a place for those who just want to have a good time without any restrictions or duties. This section of our group is not allowed to attend our events and can only see and use a limited part of our Discord. It is for people that only want to play when they feel like it and that want to be part of the 105th without attending events. It is for those who want to find new friends and play games with them or just have conversations and a good time.
                </p>
